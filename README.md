This project is a template for running a LEMP stack (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP) using Docker.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following main components:

- **Nginx**: Web server for handling requests and serving static files.

## Configuration

### Nginx 
The MySQL database configuration is set in the `.env` file . Here you can specify the database name, user, and password.
The Nginx configuration file is located at `docker/nginx/nginx.conf`. It's already preconfigured, so you do not have to worry about it. 

### MySQL
The MySQL database configuration is set in the `docker-compose.yml` file and environment variables are loaded from the `.env` file you created.

### PHP
The PHP-fpm container image is described in `docker/php/Dockerfile`
